I think that is the appropriate thing for investors to do.”\n",

      "The new regulations — which were first released as a draft in November 2018 — shift the definition of sexual misconduct to “unwelcome conduct that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive.” Previous Obama-era guidance defined sexual harassment as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” that includes “requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The new rule encompasses “all of a school’s education programs or activities,” both on and off campus.

      "Under the new guidelines, each question during the cross-examination period must first be vetted by the hearing officials. These regulations also invoke “rape shield” protections used in federal courts, which prevent either party from being asked about their sexual history.\n",

      "The grievance process outlined in the new rule is distinct from the single-investigator model that the University currently employs.

      "Beyond moving away from this single-investigator model, Harvard’s Title IX proceedings might also see a shift in the standard of evidence required to determine an instance of sexual misconduct.\n",

      "Last week, President Donald Trump effectively forced meatpacking plants around the country to remain open during the pandemic by signing an executive order designating them as “critical infrastructure.” Interestingly, the president has declined to use the same justification to speed the production of coronavirus tests and personal protective equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The industry always keeps plenty of meat in frozen storage, and because of restaurant closures we are going through this supply less quickly. Thus, the choice to keep meatpacking plants open is not attributable to the “critical” nature of the meat industry. Rather, it is more likely due to a deep-seated association between eating meat and our national identity. After all, America consumes more meat per capita than any other country. Even before this pandemic, our habits had negative consequences for animals, the environment, our public health, and workers in processing plants — but the virus might be worsening the effects. So, in times like these, rethinking that association may be necessary for our collective well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "For months, coronavirus has been spreading around meat processing plants, leading a few of them to close. To date, thousands of meatpacking workers have tested positive, and over a dozen have died. Even before the virus, meatpacking was a difficult job. Workers toil in factories described as crowded and unsafe; conditions are so harsh that it often leads to permanent physical disability. These workers also disproportionately come from vulnerable immigrant communities that might already be more susceptible to the virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The animals in these plants are also a source of concern. It’s no secret that the American meat industry doesn’t value animal welfare. The scenes from factory farms are truly awful — cattle raised in contained animal feeding operations, chickens bred to have breasts so large that they can no longer stand. Animals larger than humans are forced to spend most of their lives in darkness, confined to a few feet of space. Under ordinary circumstances, the lives of factory farm animals are miserable and short.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this situation is deteriorating further due to the virus. Because processing has slowed, there are now a lot of animals with nowhere to go. Thus, farmers are left with no choice but to kill the animals en masse. Aside from the obvious waste, what’s troubling is that animals might actually suffer more in these methods of extermination than they would otherwise. Chickens, for example, are essentially drowned by filling barns with watery foam. In the coming weeks, millions of animals will be slaughtered not for consumption, but to make room for others.\n",
      "\n",
      "These meat carcasses, disturbingly enough, might just be dumped in landfills. As their bodies decay, they will release massive quantities of methane and carbon dioxide, directly contributing to climate change. Food waste worsens the meat industry’s already severe environmental impact, and in a scenario where slaughterhouses are operating at 50 percent capacity, that seems likely to increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another frequently underestimated consequence of the meat industry is its propensity for creating and spreading disease. This isn’t strictly limited to meatpacking plants themselves, though sickness has been known to spread quickly in such conditions. Rampant antibiotic use and the crowded and unsanitary state of farms also means that disease can quickly evolve and spread among animals — and even make the leap to humans. Antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria and zoonotic diseases flourish in our factory farms. The Food and Agriculture Organization, a branch of the United Nations, has warned about the health dangers of industrial agriculture before. As far as we know, coronavirus didn’t come from animal agriculture, but it’s worth highlighting that deadly pathogens often come from animals. The way we raise our food is unnecessarily contributing to an increased risk that another pandemic will emerge in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s an obvious solution to these problems: Eat less meat, and choose the meat you do eat more carefully. Doing right by workers, animals, and the environment doesn’t necessitate vegetarianism, though it probably means scaling back consumption. When possible, we should purchase ethically-raised meat from smaller farms, and support retailers and farmers who participate in responsible agriculture. Moreover, we should make a deliberate effort to eat meat less often. If the rest of the world is any indication, we can survive perfectly well with a few more vegetables. The way we eat meat is unsustainable; the pandemic is just making that irresponsibility more obvious.\n",

      "Logging onto Zoom and attending classes could not be any more different from the typical classroom setting, even when discounting the obvious changes in scenery. With classes held virtually, professors are placed into a much more passive position and are fighting an uphill battle against distractions — the entire internet, in fact — for their students’ attention. Even the physical positions of professors have drastically changed. Instead of looking up at my professor, who normally stands behind her lectern on a podium, from a few rows behind, we now occupy the same 5-centimeter by 3-centimeter real estate on my laptop screen and, if I were to desire (which I do not), I could even speak over the professor and expel her from the enlarged speaker square. To some extent, I am literally and figuratively leveled onto the same platform as my professors and teaching fellows.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, Zoom University also redefines class participation. Breakout rooms may be fun for the first bit, but the fun kind of subsides when you end up looking at turned off cameras and muted mics. And to speak up in section, I now have to press the “Raise Hand” button, wait for my tiny blue icon to be noticed, and then unmute my mic before speaking up.\n",
      "\n",
      "By definition, transition periods are jarring, and it took some time before all of us, students and professors alike, could adapt. In the midst of this normalization, it is productive— both for sociological insight and as a pedagogical tool — to reflect on the power dynamics and norms that we had taken for granted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who speaks up normally? Who gets called on normally? Who does the calling? Do professors interact and engage with what students are most interested by? Should they do so? What roles do teaching fellows play in the classroom and in section?\n",
      "\n",
      "These questions are sometimes on the mind of students and teachers, but they are also immediately relevant to our daily interactions in clubs and other social settings. As we move all interactions to Zoom, questions about power dynamics are thrust upon us. We may suddenly acknowledge that power was disproportionately accorded to someone in a meeting merely because they used to sit close to the center, because they were more comfortable within a certain environment, or just because of how they look, dress or act.\n",
      "\n",
      "Discounting the clearly inappropriate cases, these influences are not always undue. Those who sit close to the center may do so because of the inherent structure or needs of an organization or a meeting, and someone may better fit into a role of power because they have more experience working in an environment. However, the shock of adapting to the new and different still forces us to scrutinize underlying assumptions about the accepted structures and working environments. Are we prioritizing a certain group of people? Or do our structures, in effect, result in the unjust prioritization of a certain group of people? Rarely do we have the chance to so utterly shatter the status quo, and we should seize the opportunity to understand whether our old systems are in fact the best way of operating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside of Zoom, the coronavirus also challenges existing power dynamics in our daily interactions. As the pandemic sweeps across the world and cities and countries are under lockdown, the dynamics within our societies are vastly inverted. Quarantined at home, we suddenly find ourselves reliant on the supermarket workers, cleaners, and many normally neglected workers for essential goods and services. In fact, our reliance has always existed. But not until this pandemic has this reliance been clearly exposed to challenge assumptions about economic structures and inequalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say, many of the changes that we are adapting to will be reverted as the pandemic eventually subsides — we may, hopefully, look forward to the possible return back on campus and seeing our friends and classmates. And it is imperative that some of them — the emergency powers delegated to government officials, for example — must not stay. But even so, this period of adaptation allows us to actively reflect on what is normally hidden. Assumptions about power dynamics are rarely seen in the open; we should take a good look at them when they are.\n",

      "“Harvard will be open for fall 2020,” University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote to all Harvard affiliates last Monday. But looking more closely at this “important” and “clear” decision, uncertainty remains about which parts and schools of Harvard will be open, whether the opening will be online or on-campus, and when the fall semester will actually begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the series of emails sent by the Provost, the Dean of the College, and the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, we are made acutely aware of how “large and complex” Harvard is, how this generates “a great deal of uncertainty,” and how a chorus of administrators who are equally baffled are thankful for our help, patience, flexibility, commitment, creativity, and partnership.\n",
      "\n",
      "We previously urged the University to be transparent about their decisions, asking administrators to “raise the bar for effective and frequent communication,” and we acknowledge and appreciate these efforts to communicate. But effective communications should not require deciphering and should not leave students with vastly different interpretations of what the University is thinking. We appreciate the complexity and uncertainty of the situation at hand, but communicating this problem does not require a hefty, cryptic email wrought with complexity and uncertainty that mirrors the broader situation. If the administrators know nothing other than that Harvard will operate at some — perhaps reduced — capacity next semester, then communicating that, and just that, suffices.\n",
      "\n",
      "But more than just this communicative logjam, the emails missed out on a chance to do something substantive. While details about what a fall semester will look like are subject to changes in the course of the pandemic, there are principles that must be reasserted in the midst of uncertainty. In their emails, administrators — correctly — emphasized that the wellbeing and safety of our community is paramount, but they should have done more to address the specter of significant equity challenges that hang over the possibility of an online fall semester.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the College announced an emergency universal satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading policy, Dean Gay cited “the apparent equity concerns” and the fact that the pandemic has, simply put, changed everything. Come next fall, these challenges will still be present, if not worsened by the evolving public health and financial crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "By posing the possibility of an online semester without acknowledging any of these challenges, these announcements wasted the opportunity to address them, and took it further by suggesting that improvements to an online environment could make it comparable to the real one. We remain convinced that no system, no matter how innovative and perfected an online education experience it may be, can make up for the central role that Harvard’s campus plays in our normal education. Being in the same place provides a level ground for all students to interactively learn from professors, graduate students, and each other. Whether it be one’s time zone, access to technology, mental and physical health, or living situation, there are few sufficient online substitutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to our concerns about our educational experiences, this announcement also leaves in the air student concerns about financial aid and financial security. For students working on-campus jobs, especially for those who rely on them to support themselves, an online semester may mean the loss of essential income and the possibility of having their education put at risk. In light of another potentially chaotic and unfulfilling semester, the lack of official guidance about how financial aid measures will apply if students take voluntary leaves of absence remains concerning.\n",
      "\n",
      "We hope the administration works to move beyond vague emails and a two-question survey whose value as a genuine inquiry into student opinion seems limited. As before, we insist that the administration should consult students in a more meaningful way and strive for greater clarity in its communications.\n",

      "Harvard and its peer institutions recently came under fire for being eligible to receive millions in federal aid under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Members of Congress, President Donald Trump, and many others framed the discussion as a choice between the financial health of Harvard’s $41 billion endowment on the one hand and the jobs and lives of fellow Americans on the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is dangerous to argue that because Harvard is rich, it should not be worrying about its finances. As Harvard’s financial health deteriorates, the jobs and livelihoods of thousands of taxpaying Americans will also be harmed over the next few years. Although the short-term benefits of prioritizing more vulnerable institutions and individuals outweigh the long-term costs, these costs are real and need to be included in the discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the $41 billion number, made public in June 2019, is misleading. There are serious legal and logistical hurdles involved in redirecting the more than 13,000 separate funds that make up the endowment for pandemic assistance. The vast majority of the endowment is restricted, and each fund must be individually renegotiated with the donor if the funds are to be repurposed. More importantly, Harvard’s financial health has taken a serious hit in the last few weeks. If the current economic downturn is “directly comparable” to the Great Recession, Harvard’s endowment may be posed to lose more than $10 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But tens of billions of dollars is still a lot of money. That’s why more than a third of Harvard’s annual operating budget comes from endowment returns. For example, endowment returns funded 87 and 74 percent of the Radcliffe Institute and Harvard Divinity School operating budgets for 2019. At the same time that the endowment is plummeting, operating costs are increasing. Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences is already unable to cover its budget for Fiscal Year 2020 due to $30 million in “unforeseen expenses and lost revenue.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, like any other business still operating, the University will be forced to make drastic budget cuts across the board. Although the University is already cutting non-essential spending, there will almost certainly be hiring freezes and mass layoffs. For comparison, in the aftermath of the 2009 recession, Harvard reduced food services staffing, tabled faculty salary increases, froze hiring, and laid off hundreds of employees. These cuts over the next few years will threaten the jobs and livelihoods of thousands of Americans. The most vulnerable populations on campus — staff workers, graduate students trying to negotiate insurance benefits, and the 55 percent of undergraduates who depend on financial aid to afford tuition — will be the ones harmed the most. Every dollar Harvard loses today is two dollars it cannot spend to hire workers or fund scholarships down the line. And while costs will return to normal and Harvard’s endowment will eventually recover, it will take time — Harvard’s endowment didn’t recover to pre-2008 levels until 2017.\n",

This doesn’t mean we should bail out every wealthy company. Rather, we need to avoid knee-jerk reactions that equate wealth with excess and include the long-term costs of reduced financial health in our decision-making.\n",

Their “terms” expire after about a year to limit the dispersal of their genetic material, and they receive a flat fee for each donation, with a slight scale in compensation based on the volume of the sample. In spite of its desire for Ivy League donors, the agency does not compensate them more generously than others.\n",

      "\n",
      "Still, Brandon felt strongly that any offspring should be able to connect with him if they so choose. While California Cryobank now requires all donors to sign a disclosure agreement entitling their offspring to contact them at age 18, the policy went into effect after Brandon applied; instead, he opted into the disclosure policy (which came with a monetary bonus).\n",

      "To many, sperm donation resembles “shift work,” except with unusually high pay. And California Cryobank advertises it as such: An ad on Facebook doesn’t seek to attract the deadened eye of the social-media scroller with a dazzling image of a happy, fulfilled sperm donor. Instead, accompanying the text is an image of a tanned woman, her mouth falling open as she fans out a wad of twenties to the presumably male viewers of the ad. Sperm banks commonly use easy money over altruism as their primary draw, a trend Rene Almeling charts in her 2011 book about the fertility industry. The “get cash” ad even highlights the irony of the so-called donation with the boastful quip, “Get Paid to Donate?”\n",

She travelled to California for a preliminary, one-day screening appointment that she scheduled for a Friday, when she didn’t have class, flying across the country that Thursday night. Besides the travel, she had to manage doctors’ appointments, numerous exchanges with her agency, and the medical procedures themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the factory-like nature of sperm banks makes it logical for an agency like California Cryobank to use a standardized compensation system resembling hourly wages, egg donation has an entirely different compensation model that aligns with the complexity of the process. Donors must inject fertility medications into their stomach or thigh once or twice daily, regularly visit a physician’s office to monitor developing eggs through blood tests and ultrasounds, and finally undergo surgery to retrieve the eggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "These procedures, which can result in side effects from mild discomfort to serious medical complications, last about two weeks. The screening and donation process as a whole can take up to 16 weeks.\n",

      "\n",
      "The ads placed for egg donors tend to shift the balance away from quick cash and toward the altruism of helping build a family, Almeling writes in her book, but they do not shy away from prominently featuring large sums. Moreover, the chipper advertising targeted toward college students makes both the process seem alluringly simple. An “Egg Donor Needed” advertisement posted to The Crimson’s website by the agency A Perfect Match displays a stock photo of a slim, blonde woman traipsing breezily through a wooded field at golden hour — an ideal that can be fulfilled, presumably, by securing the $60,000 that the ad promises to the successful donor.\n",
      "\n",
      "How much compensation this process warrants, and how it is determined, is an object of contention. The American Society of Reproductive Medicine wrote in their 2000 guidelines that compensation above $5,000 should require special justification and that payments above $10,000 are never appropriate. These guidelines had no legal clout, but fertility service providers largely followed them when they were in effect. Their goal was to prevent “exploitation,” especially of women in financial need who could be effectively coerced by the sum into making a choice they otherwise would not make.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in 2016, the ASRM settled a lawsuit in which a group of donors claimed that the compensation guidelines generated an unfair price-fixing practice. As a result, the Ethics Committee removed prescriptions for specific compensation sums from the 2016 version of its recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ASRM still stands by a belief that society ought “to avoid putting a price on human gametes or selectively valuing particular human traits.” To this end, the 2016 opinion by the Ethics Committee states that “compensation should not vary according to…the outcome of prior donation cycles, or the donor’s ethnic or other personal characteristics.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But in practice, these are exactly the factors that often determine egg donor compensation, which consistently rises above the ASRM’s previous limits. Some agencies offer premiums for desired traits like Ivy-League attendance or high GPA, and boutique agencies have arisen to mediate agreements between donors asking for steep compensations and parents who can oblige.\n",

Mahieu, a department supervisor at Extraordinary Conceptions, explains that while donors can negotiate compensation, the agency tries to keep its upper limit around $10,000 or $12,000 — close to the former ASRM cap. But first-time donors receive about $5,000 for a cycle with this agency, while a history of successful donation can earn a donor up to about $8,000. The agency does deliver on its “Donor in Demand” promises: According to Mahieu, those from Ivy League schools tend to receive $2,000 more than their first-time peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agency Emily used, A Perfect Match, provides consistently higher compensations than Extraordinary Conceptions.

      "\n",
      "Emily, a first-generation college student, says financial compensation was certainly an important benefit. It was a targeted Facebook ad from A Perfect Match — which she believes appeared on her feed based on her affiliation with a prestigious college — that first alerted her to the possibility of donating, but it was talking to a friend’s sister who had gone through a struggle with infertility and eventually had a child through egg donation that sealed the deal.\n",

She says that “top-tier” or “Ivy League” educations tend to generate these high-end price tags. “Usually the people that are asking for this have that level of education or higher,” she explains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the genetic considerations behind the desire for evidence of a donor’s intelligence, Crook says that intending parents often value being able to relate to a donor who has an educational background similar to theirs. Even if they never meet in person, she says, the parents may be seeking a “bond of sharing a mutual experience in some regard” with the donor.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, why parents pick their criteria doesn’t concern her, nor does she pass ethical judgment. “I don’t necessarily feel either way on this request,” she says. “I believe in mutual matching, and if [extensive or brand-name education] is something that really is important to you, then I’m certainly happy to try and find somebody that fits that criteria.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Crook’s commission doesn’t increase as donor compensation does — for its services, the agency charges a flat fee, which Crook declined to disclose. The boutique model seems to operate on the principle that allowing parents to offer as much compensation as they please and allowing donors to ask for it taps into market forces that produce precise matches. Of course, that market is one that generally leaves only the very wealthy with their detailed wish-lists fulfilled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crook recounts that a colleague from another agency made her aware of an ad they were placing on behalf of a family offering a compensation value of $250,000 — $200,000 directly and $50,000 that the donor could choose to give to charity or use for egg preservation for themselves. Their desired donor would have an “Ivy League or top tier education, clean bill of health, no cancer, no Alzheimer’s, no mental illnesses, no history of substance abuse… And they were also looking for somebody over 5’6,” blond-haired or red-haired and blue-eyed.”\n",
      "\n",

      "Emily didn’t feel that she would be actively stigmatized for her donation. But given passing experiences like hearing male peers talk about sperm donation with an air of judgment, she preferred to keep her decision private. “To do that in exchange for money, I think makes people feel — like, they’re weirded out as a whole,” she explains.\n",

      "Considering the morality of this “transaction,” Emily recognizes that the free-market forces driving the industry disadvantage low-income individuals struggling to have children.

      "Within the industry, there seems to be broad consensus that parents should be able to choose the source of their future children’s genetic material according to their personal criteria — disagreement persists mostly about the extent to which money should be involved in that process. For instance, while Brown, executive at California Cryobank, and Crook, CEO of TLC, both believe parents should pick the traits they want, Brown explains that California Cryobank charges parents the same fee for any donor because “we don’t quantify the value of our donors,” while Crook allows money to play its role in matching.\n",
      "\n",
      "But outside the industry, there is debate about whether trait selection for reasons beyond basic health is ethical at all. This debate is especially active on college campuses, where potential donors and ethicists argue over to what extent selecting for traits such as hair color or intelligence resembles a form of modern-day eugenics.\n",
      "\n",

      "Cohen argues that preferencing traits in offspring is ethically similar to selecting those traits in sexual partners. He warns against an instinct to “exceptionalize the reproductive encounters” of those who cannot conceive on their own.

Sandel, a government professor at Harvard, draws parallels between trait selection and eugenic practices.

He wrote that gamete donor selection “offers a good example of a procreative practice in which the old eugenics meets the new consumerism.”\n",

      "\n",
      "This sentiment is partly what colors Jamai Ait Hmitti’s aversion to the Durfee’s poster offering greater compensation for donors with higher grades. He agrees with Sandel that only health should matter for donor selection and worries that seeking out an educated donor implicitly signals to a child that “he was made in the goal of being smart.”\n",

      "Varying compensation according to certain traits “encourages a kind of thinking that there is some kind of genetic material that is better than others, and that takes away from the inherent value of life,” he continues. “It’s just the fact that [GPA] is a number and that it says nothing about the identity of that person.”\n",

While donation services compete to recruit Ivy Leaguers, sometimes, what they offer outcompetes an Ivy-League path.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, her affiliation with the school played a central role in her donation. She confirms that all the couples she matched with were looking for donors from “top universities.” Some prospective parents took an interest in the preschool and kindergarten testing she shared with them, which demonstrated her precocious childhood development. But Michelle says she felt that the parents also saw her as “someone they could connect with intellectually.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She recalls that one couple was “Ivy League-educated — extremely successful. And I think they were looking for someone who kind of had similar traits to what drew them to each other,” Michelle says, echoing the parallel that ethicist Glenn Cohen draws between choosing donors and choosing mates.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But they also told me that their number one criteria — after making sure that I was intelligent and, like, came from a good family — was that I was a nice person.” Michelle says that parents choose her not only based on traits that could be conveyed on paper, but also because of an affinity for her as an individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Perfect Match collected extensive documentation from Michelle, from health records and family history to test scores and transcripts. But the process did not ensure that Michelle knew even a fraction as much about intending parents. Michelle, dissatisfied with this disparity, rejected the possibility of anonymous donation and further stipulated that she would consider a match only after a conversation with the parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The talks served as her own vetting process, by which she could ensure her genes were in good hands. “I feel like there is a responsibility on the part of the donor. I don’t think reproduction is something that people should just take lightly,” she says, though she does not consider herself a mother to the children. “I need to make sure that the people who are receiving my genetics are good people whose values I agree with, who... can nurture things that I may pass on to their children.”\n",

      "For this reason, Michelle stipulates that intending parents must be financially stable. Like Emily, Michelle acknowledges that the poor are disadvantaged when the rich can drive up market prices. But the consequences, she suggests, provide a pragmatic benefit. “I don’t particularly like the way it sounds. But for me it [was] important that the parents I donated to didn’t have issues paying for the whole thing out of pocket,” she says. “I would like for my genetic children to have at least the standard of living that I had growing up, and hopefully better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Michelle reminisces about meeting the two children born from her sibling cycles, her voice fills with an excitement that transitions into solemnity. “They’re so cute. And smart. And, I mean, they definitely look like me,” she says. “And, you know, it’s just so wonderful to see something I’ve done bring so much happiness to a family.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emily, who receives emailed updates about the child born from her undergraduate donation but has never met her, says she also finds it fulfilling to witness the family’s growth, even from afar. She has since donated to another family but has not yet found out if any children were born. “I also haven't been super proactive in finding it out,” she admits. “I kind of, like, check every month or so, depending on how busy I am when it crosses my mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Though she knows more about her genetic offspring than Brandon, on the whole, Emily’s gamete donation, like Brandon’s, was not a way to change the course of her life, but rather an interlude of her college experience — a mutually beneficial arrangement for the separate lives led by her and the intending parents.\n",

      "\n",
      "“I have this monkey on my back, and this guilt,” Shannon Copeland confesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had found the perfect donor and she is raising a beloved daughter. She has just one profound regret: She should never have agreed to an anonymous donation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Michelle, who, as donors go, made sure to have plenty of contact with the families that received her eggs, waxes wistful at the prospect of further connection. “I wish I’d been more involved, to be honest, with getting to know them and such,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Copeland is currently trying to trace the donor, hoping that she may, like Michelle, be open to having more contact. Given the donor’s youth when she decided to be anonymous, Copeland reasons she may have a change of heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "The guilt she feels, though, is mostly towards her child. “In the beginning of all of this, we were never going to tell her [that she was donor-conceived],” Copeland says. Yet after coming across “all the evidence that shows your child knowing of their genetics early makes for a healthy child, makes for a healthy family unit,” she explains, “my mind changed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Since that moment, Copeland has employed every method: running her daughter’s genome through the database of genetic testing company 23andMe to find relatives, asking the agency through which she found the donor if she had other eggs available, searching a registry for other people who used the donor — so far, all to no avail.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have to stop and breathe and think, ‘Okay, we still have a lot of time,’” Copeland says. She has high hopes that one day her daughter will find her genetic family. When she does, Copeland is confident that she will find “just more people to love her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, there’s one thing she knows she can do: “I always advocate for erasing stigma around egg donors and how you came to be into this world. I think there is a stigma around this,” Copeland says. “And I will always be a voice.”\n",

Garavito ’22 launched their Instagram-based thrifting business venture @they.them.their.closet, they were darting across campus to meet new customers in dining halls, study spaces, and even their suite in Mather House. By the end of the night, they’d sold more than $100 of thrifted clothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cuadra and Garavito created @they.them.their.closet in late February. “We’re looking to make a few bucks thru selling our thrifted finds,” the caption of their first Instagram post reads. “Our goal is to become a means with which low-income QTPOC in the Cambridge/Boston area can fashion n dress themselves, all while staying baller on a budget.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We started They.Them.Their Closet purely based on the fact that we have great friends who were gassing us up on our outfits, so we bonded over both of our senses of fashion and thrift shopping,” Cuadra says. “Our friendship has derived from that shared love of fashion and identity as low-income, first-gen students. We’re also very into thrift culture, and I thought that it was a shared skill that we could turn into a profitable, locally-sourced business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They.Them.Their Closet gives Cuadra and Garavito an additional source of income, while simultaneously promoting accessibility and inclusion.. The costs of all items are up for negotiation, but prices on the page typically range from $5 to $20, with nothing exceeding $50. Cuadra and Garavito also try to subtract gender from the way they sell clothing, showcasing thrifted finds in a wide variety of sizes and styles, from size extra small bodycon dresses to large coats and jackets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can remember going to a store when I was younger and seeing the men’s sections and looking over at the women’s section and saying, ‘I want to wear something on that side of the store,’” Garavito says. “I think we wanted to take away the gender from the clothing and present it as just clothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cuadra recalled similar experiences with exploring both gendered sections while thrift shopping. They note how their mission of accessibility, as well as their personal identities, influenced the closet’s name and their selling methods.\n",

      "They hoped to use their personal style and fashion influences “so that people could find space in our closet where they could just look at clothing as clothing,” Cuadra says. “As nonbinary people, we felt like They.Them.Their Closet was a fitting name, just because it captured the intersection of our identities and our mission pretty succinctly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Though they toyed with the idea of opening a shop on Depop, a social shopping app where users individually price and sell their items, Cuadra and Garavito ultimately decided that Instagram would be the easiest and most direct way to reach their intended audience of low-income, LGBTQ+ students. By thrifting their items locally and targeting their college-aged peers, Cuadra and Garavito hope to create a personalized shopping experience for their customers.\n",

Not everyone has the time to go out of their way to buy an outfit for the weekend,” Garavito says. “I always found myself saying, ‘I don’t have time to go out and buy something for myself. I wish I had something like a thrift store that was closer to me that I could purchase clothing at.’”\n",

      "Thrifting’s rising popularity among wealthier people has raised questions about who ought to be prioritized in such spaces. Some have argued that this trend conflicts with the mission of many thrift stores like Goodwill, which explicitly seek to prioritize those less well off. While Cuadra and Garavito emphasize that their primary aim with They.Them.Their Closet is to sell clothes to low-income LGBTQ+ students, they recognized that members of those communities wouldn’t necessarily be their only customers.\n",

      "“There’s an interesting range of accusations that I’m both a Communist — that might be most common — but also a Fascist, a Nazi, and, in a recent email, [a member of the] KKK,” recounts Elizabeth Bartholet, a Harvard Law School professor and the director of the Law School’s Child Advocacy Program. The comments are a part of the tidal wave of impassioned responses she received regarding her recent article published in the Arizona Law Review calling for more strict regulations on homeschooling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although many responses have been earnest complaints from students who had positive experiences with homeschooling, others write that they “hope I die an early but prolonged and torturous death,” she says. “The expressions of racism, sexism, homophobia, and ageism are constant in these emails.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her original article claims that the lack of regulation on homeschooling poses a danger to children, because it risks depriving them of an adequate education, exposure to a diverse array of ideas, and protection from potential child abuse. In the 80-page document, she writes that only ten states require minimum education levels for homeschooling instructors, and no states require background checks for past child abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Above all, she says she fears for the children taken out of public schooling due to their parents’ religious beliefs, often those of conservative Christianity. Estimates place the fraction of parents who homeschool for religious reasons from “over half to 90 percent,” she writes. In the article, she argues that children in these situations lack exposure to beliefs and ideas beyond those held by their parents; she is particularly concerned about the children of homeschoolers who “question science and promote female subservience and white supremacy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“[Children] have a right to an education that provides them with access to a variety of viewpoints and attitudes, so that when they grow up, they have some genuine autonomy in terms of making their own choices about religion, culture, and employment,” Bartholet says. “Having children exposed to fundamental values in our society, including tolerance for other peoples’ views, is important.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bartholet ultimately calls for a “presumptive ban” on homeschooling throughout America, one in which parents who choose to homeschool must prove they are capable of providing an adequate education in a safe environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to her article, many critics have taken to virtual message boards and online publications to speak out against her views. A quick Google search yields headlines like “Harvard’s Lazy Attack on Homeschooling” in Forbes, “Harvard Law School Professor Shows her Prejudice Against Homeschoolers” in the Wall Street Journal, and “Harvard Professor Wants To Ban Homeschooling Because Christians Do It” in The Federalist.\n",
      "\n",
      "These responses, among others, take issue with Bartholet’s critiques of the role of religion in homeschooling and claim that parents have the right to raise their children as they see fit. James R. Mason, the Vice President of Litigation and Development for the Home School Legal Defense Association, says Bartholet’s proposal “comes from a worldview that’s kind of antithetical to traditional notions of liberty, especially the right of parents to raise, nurture, and educate their children.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some reverse this attack and posit that banning homeschool threatens American pluralism. Others argue that eliminating the choice for religious schooling exemplifies exactly the kind of narrow-minded pedagogy Bartholet hopes to abolish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Bartholet feels that these rebuttals miss her intended message. “There’s no way I’m for indoctrinating children in some universal majority culture,” she says. “I think parents absolutely have the right to raise their children within their own religion.” She pauses. “I just don’t think parents have a right to isolate their children from the larger culture.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bartholet’s article has also sparked a conversation about the idea of government intervention in schooling — as well as Harvard elitism. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) tweeted, “[Harvard] publish[ed] a cover story attacking home-schooling & people of faith. Elitist condescension looking down on the rest of America doesn’t wear well, even in crimson.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sen. Cruz believes school choice is the civil rights issue of the 21st century and that the federal government should not get in the way of parents’ efforts to ensure their children receive the very best education possible,” a spokesperson for Cruz writes in an email. “Far too often, Democrats and Ivy League elites look down on those who make the decision to homeschool and attempt to impose on families a one-size-fits-all approach to education.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bartholet, however, says that a lot of emails she has received are from parents who believe “that they have an absolute God-given right to control their children. So one email after another will talk about, ‘These are our children, we gave birth to them — the government has no right whatsoever to interfere with our parenting,’” she says. “I do disagree with [parental absolutism]. It’s fine if parents want to withdraw their children because they want to emphasize their own beliefs and religion, so long as they can provide an adequate education, which for me includes exposing children to ideas other than those that the parents hold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond ideological arguments, there stands the practical issue of whether public schools remain a better option than homeschooling. Bartholet says many parents have emailed her to explain that they choose to homeschool their kids to avoid bullying or because homeschooling provides a more specialized or better education than an underfunded and overcrowded public school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cevin Soling, a supporter of homeschooling and a current student at the Harvard Kennedy School, says Bartholet’s “views on the matter are uninformed, and her positions are irrational.” He says he is particularly troubled by Bartholet’s failure to recognize the downsides to compulsory public schooling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“[Compulsory school] is the last place that you want to send kids. Students’ rights or other civil rights are abusively trampled in compulsory school environments. They have all sorts of diminished freedoms: diminished [freedom of] speech, diminished due process, diminished search and seizure protections,” he says. “Their privacy is limited, and they’re tamed such that the flight impulse is diminished. And there’s all sorts of psychological, physical, emotional consequences that come from being placed in captivity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bartholet agrees that homeschooling may provide a better education for some, but she adds,“I think we would do far better as a society putting effort into reforming and improving the public schools; they definitely have lots of problems, including [failing to provide] adequate civic education.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With almost all schools moving to online classes in light of COVID-19, homeschooling, or at least schooling while at home, has become the norm for students nationwide. While Bartholet agrees that keeping education online is necessary for public health, she is concerned for particular groups of students.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One group of children — a very small set that are subject to actual maltreatment — I am very worried about them. In terms of the larger group that is going to be subjected to very limited education, I’m worried about them in terms of the long term.”\n",

      "“Reports of child abuse and neglect have plummeted by 50 percent nationwide, by 60 percent in Massachusetts. Most experts on child abuse think that there’s very likely way more child abuse and neglect going on now as families are locked into their homes,” she says. “So nobody thinks this plummeting in abuse and neglect reports indicates kids are safer, they’re almost surely in greater danger.”\n",

      "I am sitting in my childhood bedroom and looking up at the Pforzheimer belltower. Being sent away from campus in March was, perhaps, an outsized version of being quadded for the entire student body. Google Maps now tells me that the walk to Widener will take me an extra 70 hours, as opposed to the bonus 15 minutes from Pfoho that made my freshman year self shudder. As I sit at my desk, peppered with remnants of high school chemistry tests and college tours of yore, I nearly choke up at the sight of a pixelated Quad Grille.\n",
      "\n",
      "I presume that this is precisely the nostalgic reaction that a group of tutors and students in Pforzheimer sought to create when they set out to build a scale replica of their house on a Minecraft server — affectionately dubbed “Minecrapft.” Elaine Kristant, a resident tutor in the house, recalls that the idea for the project began at a dining hall table during the madness of those last few days on campus.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We were just talking about how people are going to stay connected,” she remembers, “and we just happened to be sitting with students that night that really liked playing video games… and we just mentioned, everyone should find a certain video game that they can play together.” Amidst the pandemic, Minecraft quickly became the group’s game of choice. As Kristant points out, “[it's] sort of the comfort food equivalent for video games.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The project took off once everyone had departed campus and was looking for something to keep them connected to what Francisco Matos ’20, in an email, calls his “wonderful Pfoho pfamily.” Matos, along with Kristant and others, led the charge of students and tutors who spent, as Matos describes, “the next three weeks building the house, every day and night.” The endeavor required “over 10,000 blocks of brick to construct.” They completed the project entirely in the game’s ‘survival mode,’ which entailed collecting all the materials “by hand” — virtually mining, chopping down trees, and the like.\n",

      "\n",
      "When the project kicked off, Erik Nook, a sixth year clinical psychology Ph.D. student and a tutor in the house, was busy writing his dissertation from the same floor of Pfoho that once bustled with student activity — a loss he called a “a major adjustment.” “Once I submitted,” he says, “I just spent a lot of time building because it was really fun. It was a nice decompression.” Matos echoes Nook’s sentiment that the game offered respite from the anxiety of the current moment, writing that the project “has personally helped me overcome tons of stress and keep in touch with a lot of my friends from Pfoho.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to best simulate the spaces that house so many memories for Pfoho residents, Kristant took charge of making the replica as accurate as possible. She describes the process of pinpointing the house’s scale as a “mix of using the floorplans we have, Google Maps, and just some creativity.” The result is impressive: Not only did they build the large common spaces, like the Junior Common Room and the dining hall, with precision, but they also constructed all the student rooms — spanning three buildings and five floors — with near exact dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Minecrapft team saw Housing Day as their deadline to complete the house. “We were really investing our time up until Housing Day,” Nook explains. By April 10, when freshmen received their housing assignments via ‘Zoom storming’, the house was ready for visitors.\n",
      "\n",

      "The Minecraft world, composed of rough, earth-toned, 3D blocks, only allows for highly stylized recreations of real world spaces. However, as Nook leads me around the house, his tour reminds me that the majority of memory is composed of fuzzy recollections, not of moments as they precisely were. Night has fallen in the virtual quad as we walk through the memorable Pforzheimer gates, and I vividly remember a December night my freshman year, shivering underneath those arches — having been ejected from the Igloo in an outfit completely inappropriate for a bitterly cold Cambridge night. As we enter the Quad Grille, I recall the sigh which marked the futility of my mozz stick order as I ran to catch the quad shuttle back to my river home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creating these sorts of recollections for students is what Nook says has made the project so rewarding. “It really warms my heart when I just hear the connection and recognition in student’s voices when I show them this,” he says. “I just get the sense it brings back a lot of happy memories for them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to get an overhead screenshot of the house, and Nook tells me this will be best accomplished by harvesting enough wood to build a bird’s eye podium. As we walk to chop our wood, we encounter a few monsters and multiple sheep, no doubt abnormal April afternoon occurrences in the Radcliffe Quadrangle. After building and ascending our podium, it begins to rain profusely in our virtual world, obscuring the house from our view. We chat for a few minutes about the intricacies of defending a dissertation, but the cyber rain will not let up and virtual night time is closing in on us again. I log off, content with the moody aesthetic of the pictures I did capture.\n",

      "Two days after the U.S. reported its first death from COVID-19 but weeks before it issued mandatory stay-at-home orders and shut down schools, Dr. Vivian G. Shaw, a Harvard College Fellow in the University’s sociology department, tweeted, “I’m starting a new project documenting xenophobia and racism related to coronavirus. If you have stories, perspectives, or other info to share please feel free to send to me... Planning to expand this into an interview-based project at a later date.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The tweet garnered hundreds of retweets and likes, and Shaw received an influx of personal anecdotes and potential leads for her research. Soon she realized that the scope of the project had expanded beyond her alone. “If I wanted to research this phenomenon well, I would need to bring on more people,” Shaw says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the AAPI COVID-19 Project, housed at Harvard’s Department of Sociology, comprises a team of eight researchers from multiple universities. Under Shaw’s leadership, they seek to investigate how COVID-19 — as both a virus and a social construction — is impacting Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander (AAPI) individuals and communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the project team came the project infrastructure. The “architecture” of the project, according to Shaw, focuses on six main areas: labor and the economy, community-based organizations, health, education, caregiving and family, and online space — the last category inspired by a story she received about an Asian man on a gay dating website being referred to as “coronavirus.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anecdotes about people experiencing or observing racism drove Shaw to pursue the project. “I was also hearing stories about people worrying about their children,” she says. “[People worried] about how the pandemic was going to increase the risk of their children experiencing racism and xenophobia in very direct ways.”\n",
      "\n",
      "These stories were not necessarily surprising to her — she has extensive experience, she says, “looking at social movements and racial politics after disasters.” At the conception of the AAPI COVID-19 Project, Shaw was in the process of developing a book manuscript from her dissertation, “Post-disaster Citizenship: The Politics of Race, Belonging, and Activism after Fukushima.” Based on ethnographic fieldwork, her dissertation examines the simultaneous rise of hate speech and activism after the 2011 nuclear disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hate speech is a very extreme form of discrimination — not something that you would consider ‘everyday,’” Shaw says. Its visibility inspires action, often in the form of activism.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Shaw is also interested in a larger, overarching question: “How is racism structural?” she asks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How is it embedded in how they can access healthcare, how they can vote, different types of legal ramifications?” she says. “That sort of stuff is maybe less exciting than hate speech, but it’s still there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Shaw found that galvanizing people to view hate speech as a symptom of ongoing, structural, and less sensationalized inequality was a significant challenge for post-Fukushima activism. “What you see happening is activists who are coming from relatively privileged backgrounds — maybe they’re Japanese, they’re male, they’re straight, they’re cis men — becoming more aware about inequality because they’re experiencing this insecurity more directly,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shaw brings up the view, popular in the media, that the pandemic is an “equalizer.” But this crisis, she says, cannot be labeled so simply: COVID-19 has created a dynamic where privileged activists must reckon with “issues that people who have been living within this kind of marginalized status have known for a long time,” she says. Now, “they have to come together and figure out how to negotiate their different tools or different frameworks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus emerges a question central to Shaw’s interrogation of Fukushima, and, now, COVID-19: “How do communities deal with a problem that becomes more visible in a specific moment when that problem has been something that has been going on for a long time?”\n",

      "While the social consequences of COVID-19 appear novel, their origins are all too familiar. “We're connecting existing and old problems to the current crisis,” Shaw says.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AAPI COVID-19 Project aims to illuminate some of these “old problems” that “aren’t getting covered as much,” Shaw notes, like stories of shuttering Chinese restaurants, South Asians in the gig economy losing business, undocumented Asian immigrants losing access to healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another such problem, less visible in mainstream coverage of this crisis — or any crisis — is the gendered component to hate speech, racism, and xenophobia. Much of Shaw’s past work on crisis activism revolves around how gender shapes a community’s vulnerability and social response to disaster — a phenomenon that undeniably manifests itself through COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For instance, a lot of care workers are women,” Shaw notes. “We’re looking at the gendered aspects of this pandemic — things like domestic violence, things like the burden of care, that is all gendered.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Shaw illuminates the necessity of intersectionality in community activism. “Oftentimes, the different types of vulnerabilities that Asian American women experience get sidelined and overlooked because there is a lack of intersectional analysis within the community,” she says. “I think in general many communities suffer from not necessarily having that sort of vocabulary or consensus about the importance of thinking intersectionally.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While Shaw doesn’t “claim to have an answer” to the question of how communities should go forward, she does recognize the role that education can serve. It should be “something beyond just peer reviewed journal articles” inaccessible to the vast majority of such communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If academics want to be part of the solution, we need to think about how to translate our work in ways that are understandable and also engaging for different audiences,” she adds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, education might look something like “Asian American Feminist Antibodies: Care in the Time of Coronavirus,” a zine that Shaw helped to edit. Published by the Asian American Feminist Collective, the zine includes essays and art that speak to the varied experiences of AAPI womanhood during the outbreak, as well as a section for community resources. Its authors highlight the intersections of violence exacerbated by COVID-19, from incarceration to disability activism; at the same time, Shaw says that it is most fundamentally a project of “revolutionary love and care.”\n",
      "\n",
      "According to its introduction, co-authored by Shaw, the zine orients itself not toward the present but toward alternate futures. Intersectional crisis activism, for this zine, means the creation of “interdependent communities of resistance.”\n",

      "“Survivor” is a game of elaborate, televised rituals.\n",
      "\n",
      "One such ritual, known as the “loved ones visit,” occurs when six or so contestants remain. After 30 days of grueling challenges, chronic malnourishment, and demanding strategic play, “Survivor” flies out one loved one per player, usually a family member or spouse. Jeff Probst summons the visitors onto the beach one at a time from behind the trees. The clean loved one and the dirty, smelly player embrace, briefly, before the player (and occasionally the loved one) must compete in a challenge to win more time with each other. The winners traipse back to camp to enjoy a feast together. The losers get nothing; their loved ones wave goodbye and blow tear-stained kisses before disappearing back into the forest. Families across America are left verklempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The loved one’s visit is premised on a simple idea, one that Probst propagates freely in his pre-challenge banter: The mere experience of being held by someone who knows and loves you, of sharing a conversation with a person you can actually trust, is not just restorative but physically and emotionally energizing. It’s a reward that can sustain a player through the final nine days of the game, like peanut butter (an oft-referenced and highly treasured energy booster on “Survivor”) on steroids. It’s Day 30’s eleventh-hour savior.\n",
      "\n",
      "So imagine the genuine surprise of “Survivor” devotees when, on April 15, they tuned into the 10th episode of this season — at which point ten players still remained — only to hear these words from Probst: “Even in a war like this, it’s important to lay down your weapons and remind yourselves what, and who, you’re playing for.” In came the loved ones, four weeks ahead of schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visible shock on the players’ faces, followed immediately by convulsive, joyful sobs and a fair bit of confusion, reflected my precise emotions. It was too early for this, I thought. The players weren’t truly exhausted yet, their emotional and physical resources insufficiently depleted. Not to mention, what would sustain them in the final days? Actual peanut butter?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, the unusual visit fits the unusual season. “Survivor Season 40: Winners at War” is the first in show history to bring together a full cast of past winners. Each of these players has won the million; some have played the game two, three, even four times. They all owe their fame, desired or not, to “Survivor.” Some owe their entire careers, or formal lack thereof, to the show. But more importantly, “Survivor” owes them — their stars, the fan favorites who permit themselves to be sprinkled among seasons like viewership fairy dust — big time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It felt cosmically fair, then, that CBS would fly out the players’ entire families for these most epic of competitors. Gaggles of young children poured out of the woods, some barely recognizing their parents and others running full-force into their arms. I couldn’t help but grimace at the thought of these kids being dragged back towards the waiting Fiji Airlines jet when their beleaguered parent inevitably lost the challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in an unprecedented first, there was no challenge. The players and their spouses and kids were sent back to camp to eat and be merry in one giant reality/“Survivor” crossover cookout. This is all not to mention the simultaneous loved ones’ visit to the castaways on the Edge of Extinction, a second beach where the very famous and popular players who have already been voted out are fiddling away the hours in televised purgatory rather than their homes. There — in a particularly heartwarming moment — Amber and “Boston” Rob Mariano, who met 20 years ago on “Survivor,” embraced their four children under the merciful auspices of the maniacal show that brought them together in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The resulting episode — a maximalist waterworks show covering a whopping 19 different family visits at once — wasn’t good, per se. There was little of the dramatic momentum that catapults the best episodes towards Tribal Council. Fully half of the episode was plotless — a sort of stylized Bring-Your-Kids-To-Work Day for “Survivor”’s royal families — filled with shots of cute kids frolicking in the Fijian waters. As such, all of the gameplay was squeezed, tepidly, into the back half of the hour.\n",

      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "But none of that mattered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much like the existence of the Edge of Extinction, the post-filming press junkets have indicated that the full-family loved ones’ visit was an important condition of return for some winners. “Survivor” wanted them back; they came, but with stipulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herein lies the evolution of the twisted, loving push and pull between the game and its players. Imagine any “Survivor” contestant in the show’s first 10 years making public demands in exchange for their return. The show controlled them; it would have been inconceivable. Even today, the producers are the gods. Once on the island, players can do nothing but adapt to whatever’s thrown at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet in this episode, with its early and aggressively generous loved ones’ visit, “Survivor” bowed to gods of its own creation — literal totemic deities, even — as they finally dictated their own rituals.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the people’s gods. Nothing is more thrilling to us, the viewers, than an increasing sense of collective control over the game. It’s less a power struggle than a strong-willed crew of fans, players, and producers growing together into a real “Survivor” family where we get the kids on weekends.\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed every minute of this episode, melodramatic as it was. It might have had a little something extra to do with the sight of loved ones, kept far apart for an extended period of time, finally getting to hug and kiss each other again.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s no way the show could have predicted that this episode would strike a painfully relevant chord today, as many of us pine for a loved one’s visit of our own. And yet — with “Survivor”— anything’s possible.\n",
      "bvious reasons, the phrase “quarantine haircuts” has been trending on Google. With no exact timeline ahead, it seems like self-isolation might be the perfect time for a daring reinvention.

I cried for many hours, happy that I didn’t look like a pencil, but sad that I looked like a triangle. Since then, I’ve realized that this style is both effortless and easy to upkeep as long as you go heavy on the layering. To replicate at home, use bouts of extreme anxiety to chop off random sections: presto, layers.\n",

      "Few political activists can set a trend like Jane Fonda. After speaking at an anti-Vietnam War event in 1970, Fonda was arrested at the Cleveland Airport on suspected drug smuggling charges. In her mugshot, her characteristically blonde lob has been traded in for a dark, uneven mullet that hairstylist Paul McGregor gave her when she desired something more punk. Though a haircut should never be mistaken for activism, you might want to give this one a try if you are looking for some edge.\n",
      "Jordan Peele, horror-movie and comedy extraordinaire, is returning to strike edge-of-your-seat fear and thought-provoking awe into the hearts of moviegoers nationwide. After the successes of “Get Out” and “Us,” Peele (as co-producer and writer) has partnered with rising-star director Nia DaCosta for the upcoming motion picture “Candyman.” The film figures to be somewhat of a departure from Peele’s first two hits: “Candyman” is a reinterpretation of the 1992 horror film of the same name. That iteration of “Candyman” drew criticism for its troublesome treatment of race. Now, almost 30 years later, DaCosta and Peele have set out to give their own telling of the story. While the coronavirus pandemic has postponed the film’s release to September, the “Candyman” trailer offers clues as to how this iteration will play out.\n",
      "\n",
      "This debut trailer gives viewers much to digest in just over two minutes. It first lays out the basics: a refresher for those who know the original and background for those who do not. It opens as a man named Anthony (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), dressed in a red beanie and grey t-shirt, tells the ominous legend of Candyman: “If you say his name five times looking in the mirror, he appears in the reflection and kills you.” The trailer cuts to a group of schoolgirls repeating “Candyman” into the school-bathroom mirror. Nothing happens for a moment, and the teenagers breathe a sigh of relief. This feeling is premature, however, as a flourish of camera angles and chilling sounds follow. Afterwards, the only thing left is a makeup mirror, covered with blood and bees. In the edge of the mirror, we can barely make out the reflection of a figure with a bloodied yellow coat and a hook arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, the trailer turns on its head and gives a glimpse into the undercurrents that drive the film. The setting, viewers learn, is Cabrini-Green: “It was a projects,” Anthony says. Anthony –– who is apparently a painter and photographer new to the area –– comes across an old church and compares it to an old, grainy photo. The church, once exposed dark brick, is now painted white –– a not-too-subtle visual signal that Cabrini-Green has been gentrified. The artist soon sees and hears about the dreaded Candyman, graffitied on walls and etched in the minds of older residents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anthony becomes obsessed with Candyman and creates an entire art exhibition devoted to the figure, full of paintings and mirrored exhibits. The trailer jumps around: Anthony dares visitors to say “Candyman,” and people oblige. One woman –– perhaps out of context, but presciently –– warns, “Don’t say that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What comes next isn’t clear –– it’s obvious, though, that things turn very bad. In the closed art exhibition, an invisible force with a man’s reflection drags, lifts, and attacks visitors. In the next cut, Anthony gazes into the mirror and gasps as he sees what can only be Candyman –– yellow coat, hook arm, bees, and all – staring back. “I brought him back,” Anthony professes. Soon, he exchanges the red beanie and t-shirt for a painter’s disheveled garb. Next, Anthony screams in seemingly mental agony. As a booming voice (presumably Candyman) proclaims, “I am the writing on the wall,” the trailer races through scenes with plenty of fear, death, and gore. The art museum, the local laundromat, the abandoned church –– it seems nothing is left untouched by Candyman. All the while, an ominous-sounding remix of “Say My Name” by Destiny’s Child provides the pulsating soundtrack.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the trailer’s final seconds, a young boy walks to a bathroom, only to find a body blocking the door. Peering nervously through a small gap in the door and into the bathroom mirror, he recoils at the sight of blood, bees, and a hook reaching around the bathtub curtain. Here, the trailer ends, leaving the viewer with plenty of unanswered questions. What is Candyman’s story? What does “I am the writing on the wall” imply? Why does Anthony see himself as Candyman in the mirror –– does it hold a literal and metaphorical meaning? Only by peering nervously at the screen will we find the answers. It’s clear that “Candyman” promises much more gore, thought-provoking commentary, and many more scares.\n",

      "Vanessa Wye believes she’s “not a victim because I’ve never wanted to be, and if I don’t want to be, then I’m not.” She doesn’t consider her relationship with her teacher, Mr. Strane, to be abusive, even though it began when she was 15 years old. In fact, she sees her affair with Strane to be the great love of her life, even 10 years later. When other students come forward accusing Strane of sexual harassment, Vanessa is left to confront her past. Even then, she resists the label of “victim.”\n",

      "Kate Elizabeth Russell’s debut novel, “My Dark Vanessa,” is an uncomfortable book. Headlines describe it with words like “controversial” and “shocking.” It was originally chosen as a pick for Oprah’s Book Club, but the novel was dropped because the book club was wary of another controversy so soon after the one involving Jeanine Cummin’s “American Dirt.” Yet even without the backing by Oprah, it still became a best-seller.\n",
      "\n",
      "Words like “controversial” and “shocking” don’t begin to describe the feelings this book brings up. There are gut-wrenchingly awful depictions of rape, made all the more horrific by their highly erotic descriptions given through Vanessa’s point of view. And while it is so apparent to the reader that Strane is a pedophile — a 42-year-old is asking his student, a minor, to dress in childish pajamas and to say, “I love you, Daddy,” infantilizing an already underage girl — Vanessa shies away from describing him as such. In fact, the word “pedophile” doesn’t appear until over 100 pages in, followed by Vanessa’s immediate insistence, “But no, that word isn’t right, never has been. It’s a cop-out, a lie in the way it’s wrong to call me a victim and nothing more. He was never so simple; neither was I.” It’s always difficult to read as a character processes trauma; it’s even harder watching Vanessa destroy herself by reliving it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many ways to evaluate a book, one of which is to look at it as an object of art. It’s difficult to critically assess “My Dark Vanessa” because it is so deeply tied to such a heavy topic. To criticize the book feels too much like criticizing Vanessa, or anyone like her who may have had these experiences. But this may be due to the fact that the book offers little else. Often the minor characters feel flat, like pawns placed solely to take part in Vanessa’s story. It’s hard to imagine those characters having a life off the page. This one-dimensionality makes the book feel all the more oppressive, and it’s hard to decide if the effect is purposeful or a problem of writing fundamentals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the most salient part of this novel is its discussion of power. The book is riddled with the term. Of course, Strane has a great deal of power in this situation: He’s older, he’s the teacher, and early on in the relationship, his word means more than hers. But Vanessa comes to a realization: “I have power. Power to make it happen. Power over him.” She believes she has a hold over Strane since he’s risking his job to be with her. She could send him to jail. This is Vanessa’s main reason for not speaking out against him. If she claims victimhood, Vanessa believes she’s relinquishing all the power she believed she had. That, along with the fear that comes with speaking about her past (“But if someone doesn’t want to come forward and tell the world every bad thing that’s happened to her, then she’s what? Weak? Selfish?”), is enough to keep Vanessa silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Dark Vanessa” is a troubling book. It’s difficult to imagine recommending this to an acquaintance. There are scenes that are so upsetting it seems impossible that you’ll finish. And there are a few plot inconsistencies and characters that could use some fleshing out. After all of that, there come the uncomfortable questions: Does Vanessa enable Strane as an adult, helping him rehash his pedophilic fantasies? Does she hold power? Can a 15 year-old consent to a relationship with a much older teacher? The book doesn’t provide all the answers, leaving its reader with lingering questions that will haunt you for days.\n",

      "Prior to making this decision, Dean had plenty of highlights since he started taking the sport seriously in the eighth grade. He won sculling in both 2017 and 2018 at the World Junior Championships, which prompted his selection for U.S. Rowing Junior National Athlete of the Year two years in a row. The following year, he rowed for the United States senior team.\n",

      "\n",
      "While Dean clearly demonstrated his prowess for sculling (rowing in a boat for a single rower) in his high school years, his freshman year at Harvard highlighted his talent for rowing in a crew. He stroked the varsity eight at many big regattas, including the race against Yale, IRA National Championships, and Eastern Sprints. When asked whether he prefers rowing or sculling, Dean hesitated before offering his thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a good question,” he said. “[Sculling] is very straightforward and very simple to train… [Rowing in an eight] is bigger, it's faster, and you're surrounded by your friends… There are pros and cons to each.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By early 2019, however, Dean announced that he would not be returning to Harvard in the fall; instead, he would be withdrawing from the College in the 2019-2020 academic year to vie for a spot to row in a U.S. boat at the Tokyo Olympics. This was not a new idea, but rather, it was an aspiration that had been percolating in his head from a relatively young age that increasingly became more realistic with time. He said that he has “always kept that option open,” so he was mentally prepared to possibly graduate with a different class when he began freshman year. Although Clark is an invaluable member of the Harvard men’s heavyweight crew team, he received plenty of encouragement from his coaches to pursue his goals.\n",

      "When the 2019-2020 academic year rolled around, Dean hit the ground running. The year kicked off with the 2019 World Championships at the end of the summer, which carried more significance in a pre-Olympic year by determining which boats qualify for the Olympics. Dean raced in a straight four, and the team successfully placed in the top-eight finishers and qualified the American boat for Tokyo. The American eight also qualified.\n",

      "Although Dean was a large contributor to the American straight four’s success, there’s a catch: while Dean and his three boatmates qualified that specific boat type at the Olympics for the United States, he does not have a guaranteed spot in that boat. In order to earn that spot, Dean would have to train at the National Team Training Center in Oakland, Calif., with all of the other elite rowers who were competing for spots in the straight four and the eight. While it may help Dean’s case that he raced in one of the qualifying boats, he would still have to train and compete until final decisions on the boats were made in June of 2020.\n",

While none of them had been teammates at school, they were all familiar after having raced against each other in the past.\n",

      "A typical day for Dean while training in Oakland looked like this: he would wake up at 5:45 a.m. and have breakfast, and by 6:20 a.m., he would be launched for a morning row. At approximately 9:00 a.m., he would finish his row, shower, and start working remotely for a job he had started in the spring of 2019. Then, between 3:00 and 6:00 p.m., Dean would go to the boathouse again for either an individual workout or another row. At around 7:00-8:00 p.m., he would have dinner with his “rotating dinner club” consisting of his roommates and other members of the team. That schedule would repeat itself every weekday, and on the weekends, they would have a long row on Saturday morning and the rest of the weekend off.\n",

      "AN EARLY START TO THE OFF-SEASON\n",
      "\n",
      "When news broke that the Tokyo Olympics would be postponed to 2021 and that the National Team Training Center had to close, there were only 18 rowers left in the camp. Dean was the youngest rower by far; he had turned 20 years old this past February, and the youngest rowers after him were 23 or 24 years old. He said the average age at the camp was approximately 27-28 years old, and that some of them were just over 30 years old. Some of the older athletes were planning on retiring after the 2020 Olympics if they were selected to compete, so they are now facing the decision of whether they should continue training for another year. Understandably, Dean was disappointed by the cancelation, but he had more empathy for his older teammates.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I definitely got off the easiest because I have school to go back to; I am now going to graduate right before the pre-Olympic Worlds to qualify for the next one, and it's absolutely not the end of the road for me,” Dean said. “A lot of people are in way tougher positions than I am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Needless to say, Dean’s training schedule has completely changed since the Olympics were officially postponed. While he was a couple of short months away from peaking, he now has to reverse his training schedule and essentially begin his off-season.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dean is currently staying at his home in Sarasota, Fla., and the other rowers also went home until further notice. In order to take a break from the high-impact, repetitive motion of rowing, Dean is focusing on cross-training for now and is mostly running and biking. While it is unclear when he will begin rowing again, he has concluded that it “depends on what happens countrywide with the virus.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "From here, it is only natural to wonder about Dean’s next step: will he take another year off from Harvard to train for Tokyo, or will he return to school? The answer is that he is hoping to return to school to graduate with the Class of 2023. If Dean took another year off, then he would lose a season at Harvard, because he is only granted five years for four seasons, and now he has three years left for three remaining seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harvard as a school, the rowing program, the coaches, and the team have already done so much for me that I definitely owe it to them to get my remaining three years of racing done,” Dean said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it is now more difficult for Dean to qualify for the 2021 Olympics, his hopes are not completely dashed. “[The chance of qualifying for Tokyo is] definitely a lot smaller than it would have been this year, but it's not zero. I [also] have 2024, so it's not like this is my last run at it.”\n",

      "One early morning during Seth Towns’ sophomore year, a “No Caller ID” phone call awoke the Winthrop House resident. Picking up the out-of-the-blue call, Towns recognized a familiar voice on the other end, one that he had heard numerous times in interviews.\n",

      "\n",
      "Two days prior, Towns had casually discussed in the coaches office that he was an avid reader of the renown sports journalist-turned-inspirational storyteller. Having finished around five of Albom’s works that have topped The New York Times bestseller list, the sociology concentrator was particularly interested in the author’s philanthropy work.\n",

That would be the last time the 2018 Ivy League Player of the Year would ever suit up in a Crimson uniform, as he battled through a frustrating two-surgery, two-year-long ordeal to fix the cartilage tear in the knee.\n",

      "Now, the No.1 graduate transfer in the portal according to ESPN will have two seasons to fulfill his lifelong dream to play for his hometown Ohio State Buckeyes.

      "\n",
      "“[What] a lot of people don’t understand about Harvard Basketball is that it is a fraternity that can connect you with so many different people, so many different endeavors,” Towns said. “In my time at Harvard, I’ve had in-depth conversations with civil rights activists that I’ve looked up to when I was in high school, my favorite author [Mitch Albom], and Lloyd Blankfein, who’s Lloyd Blankfein.\n",
      "\n",
      "“[Coach Amaker] is so adamant about exposing us to the movers and shakers of the world, and I mean it’s incredible for me.”\n",

      "Towns added he continues to maintain a strong relationship with three past Institute of Politics guest speakers at Harvard Basketball-sponsored discussions - former U.S. Secretary of Education and Crimson alumni Arne Duncan ‘87, civil rights activist and sociologist Harry Edwards, and basketball analyst Clark Kellogg. Kellogg is an Ohio native himself and mentioned that the two had begun to build a connection when Towns was still at Northland High School in Columbus.\n",

      "But it was also as much the experience of being off the court for two years that has instilled a newfound understanding of himself, and in his passion for the game. Towns credits the six other seniors in his much-heralded recruiting class for providing him with the positivity and friendship he needed throughout his four years.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We were all in it together the whole time so… overall, we are this band of brothers,” Towns said. “I’m super thankful for those guys, they lifted me up in a lot of different ways. So I can’t thank them enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The role as a co-captain this past season was also an unexpected learning experience for Towns, something that has provided him with new insight on his own game.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t realize how much I would love the role of being the captain of the team until the games started flowing,” Towns said. “I was just as into it as I would have been if I was playing it...I was just watching basketball, trying to increase the value of the team in any way I could. So when you have that perspective for two years it absolutely changes the basketball player you are, and makes you value everything about winning.”\n",

      "Amid controversy over the tenure denial of Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview last week that he has never reversed a tenure decision during his time at Harvard, nor did when he served as president of Tufts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The University informed García Peña — who specializes in Latinx studies — of the decision not to grant her tenure Nov. 27. Harvard affiliates have since protested the denial, staging a sit-in in University Hall and outside the Provost’s office, writing letters to administrators, and organizing rallies in Harvard Yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bacow said last Friday that tenure cases are presided over by the University President or by the Provost. He would not comment on who chaired García Peña’s tenure committee or who the members of the committee were.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bacow said he has never seen a tenure decision reversed during his time as a university president.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've never reversed a tenure decision,” Bacow said. “I have not seen one reversed during my time as president of Tufts. I don't recall one ever being reversed during my time as Chancellor of MIT.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bacow served as president of Tufts from 2001 to 2011 and chancellor of MIT from 1998 to 2001.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the interview, Bacow repeatedly refused to answer questions related to the nature of García Peña’s tenure denial.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot comment on confidential discussions about any particular faculty member in a promotion case,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "An ethnic studies protestor came into direct contact with Bacow at the December Faculty of Arts and Sciences Meeting, where the individual stood at the front of the room holding a sign calling on Harvard to reverse García Peña’s tenure decision, among other demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meeting, Bacow asked the protestor to move to the side of the room and provide their name. When the individual did not respond, he called the faculty to a vote to compel the protestor to move. Multiple faculty members dissented, and the protester remained in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reiterating his statements at the Faculty meeting, Bacow said in the interview last Friday that it was “poor precedent” for the faculty to allow the protestor to stay in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought it was poor precedent to have somebody stand and protest in the middle of the room,” Bacow said. “I asked him to move to the side.”\n",
      "\n",
      "García Peña is not the first faculty member specializing in ethic studies to have been denied tenure in recent years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gay began a nationwide search in June to hire three to four faculty members who specialize in Asian American, Muslim American, and Latinx studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, at least three tenure-track professors who specialize in race or religion have either been denied tenure or left the University since 2018. In November 2018, the University declined to tenure Harvard Graduate School of Education associate professor Natasha K. Warikoo; History assistant professor Genevieve A. Clutario accepted a position at Wellesley College soon after; and the Divinity School denied tenure last spring to Science and Religion associate professor Ahmed Ragab.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bacow referred questions about the development of ethnic studies at Harvard to FAS Dean Claudine Gay, calling ethnic studies “an issue for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.”\n",

      "Harvard’s arboretum workers unanimously ratified a new contract Wednesday, securing an annual three percent increase in wages for the four years the contract is in place, along with new benefits and job classifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 17 permanent staff who maintain the arboretum grounds in Boston — along with full-time seasonal employees — are represented by 32BJ SEIU, a union comprising many groups of workers across the University. 32BJ SEIU also represents roughly 1,000 Harvard custodians and security guards, but each unit negotiates its own contract. The arboretum workers’ contract expired Nov. 15, which was also the day that the two sides reached a tentative agreement on a replacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "32BJ SEIU Vice President Roxana Rivera said the bargaining committee felt “very strongly” that they had come to a good tentative agreement and voted unanimously to bring it to the membership for ratification.\n",
      "\n",
      "The contract was ratified 18-0 Wednesday, according to alternate shop steward and horticulturist Laura J. Mele.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the wage increase, the contract adds one personal day for full-time employees, creates a new job classification of lead horticulturist, and allows seasonal employees to take holiday, sick, and vacation time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was very important to ensure that these workers and their families were able to stay up with the rising cost of living in Boston,” Rivera said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shop steward Nima Samimi, who works as a gardener, said he was “proud” of the contract he and his co-workers had won.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In a time when employers in many different sectors are chipping away at contracts, we were able to maintain our wages, benefits, [and] rights at a high level, which is a big deal in horticulture in particular, since our sector is rarely unionized,” Samimi said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although bargaining stretched to the final day of the previous contract, Rivera said this was not because of contentions in the negotiations, but an “issue of schedule.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "“There wasn’t an issue of, you know, where we didn't think that either side was bargaining in good faith,” Rivera said.\n",
      "\n",
      "University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the two sides met for 10 to 12 formal negotiating sessions since September and came to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This agreement recognizes the important role SEIU 32BJ workers have in the success of the Arboretum’s mission and work, and reflects the commitment on the part of both the SEIU and the University to a fair and equitable agreement that provides additional benefits and wage increases to union members, alongside operational flexibility for Arboretum management,” Swain wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rivera said that because the contracts for the janitorial staff and security guards each expire in November 2020, instead of alongside the arboretum workers’, she felt it was important to negotiate a strong contract for the arboretum workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was important for us to...win a good contract for the Harvard Arboretum workers because I think that, you know, will help as we go into next year for the rest of the bargaining unit,” Rivera said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mele said that although the unit was “fortunate” to already have a strong previous agreement, all 17 members met once a week since February to discuss potential improvements. Each person researched the history and implementation of one or two contract articles and brought any concerns to the group, Mele said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unit consists of horticulturalists, arborists, and gardeners, Mele said. A typical day includes meeting in the morning to discuss priorities, then dispersing in teams of two to three to maintain various aspects of the 281-acre grounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is basically a living museum so every tree and shrub has been planted on purpose and collected from all over the world,” Mele said. “It's really a very unique job.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Correction: Dec. 14, 2019\n",
      "\n",
      "A previous version of this article stated that arboretum workers secured a three percent raise for the four years the contract is in place. To clarify, they secured an annual three percent increase for each of the four years.\n",
